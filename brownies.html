                    <li> &frac12; cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li> 2 tablespoons water</li>
                    <li> &frac12;teaspoon vanilla</li>
                </ul>
            <h2><em>STEPS</em></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix together, in two different bowl, the dry and wet ingredients</strong></li>
                        <p>Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl.
                           Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large bowl.</p>
                    <li><strong>Combine together wet and dry ingredients</strong></li>
                            <p>Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. <em>The batter will be thick!</em></p>
                    <li><strong>Pour the batter in an 8&times;8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper</strong></li>
                            <p>Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four side of the pan and to smooth the top.</p>
                    <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 160°C</strong></li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li><strong>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes</strong></li>
                            <p>The secret to check a best baking is the <em>trick of toothpick</em>.
                                If it comes out with a few crumbs attached, its the moment to remove the pan from the oven.</p>
                </ol>
                <p><strong><em>It's better to pull them out too early than to leave them in too long...</em></strong></p>
                    <p>No one likes dry brownies, so pay attention to the toothpick trick.
                        They'll continue to firm up as they cool!</p>                
                <p><strong><em>Wait for them to cool!</em></strong></p>
                    <p>Try your best to resist eating these guys straight out of the oven. 
                        Letting them cool makes them gooier and fudgier, and they'll be less likely to crumble when you slice them. 
                        Plus, they'll have an even richer chocolate flavor. <em>It's worth the wait!</em></p>
